# PRNTSCRN Manifest

## 1. TL;DR

**PRNTSCRN** is a next-generation, AI-augmented document automation platform designed to empower small and medium businesses (SMBs) to create professional, brand-consistent, InDesign-quality proposals, tenders, and marketing documents—quickly, affordably, and at scale. By combining modular document assembly, AI-powered content generation, and true design automation, PRNTSCRN bridges the gap between basic tools and complex enterprise software, making high-fidelity outputs accessible to all.

---

## 2. Overview

PRNTSCRN is a secure, modular, and cloud-native platform that enables SMBs to produce visually rich, structured documents with ease. It leverages a modern web UI, a secure agent architecture, and enterprise-grade design tools (notably Adobe InDesign) to automate and streamline the document creation process. PRNTSCRN is built on immutable, containerized, and event-driven principles, ensuring reproducibility, traceability, and strong separation of concerns.

---

## 3. Vision

Modern SMBs face increasing pressure to deliver high-quality, branded documents for tenders, proposals, and marketing—yet lack the resources for in-house design or expensive enterprise tools. PRNTSCRN envisions a world where:

- Document creation is fast, automated, and accessible to all
- AI and design automation work together to deliver enterprise-quality outputs
- Compliance, branding, and personalization are built-in, not bolted on
- SMBs can compete with larger firms on a level playing field

---

## 4. Market Gaps and Opportunity

### 4.1 Market Gaps

- No affordable, design-rich automation platform for SMBs
- Existing tools (Canva, Google Docs) lack deep design control and modular assembly
- Enterprise solutions (Adobe AEM, XaitCPQ) are too costly and complex
- AI writing tools don’t handle layout, branding, or compliance

### 4.2 Opportunity

- Deliver modular, brand-compliant, AI-assisted document generation at SMB pricing
- Focus on underserved industries (construction, healthcare, government tenders)
- Enable rapid, compliant, and visually compelling outputs without technical skills

## 5. Core Features

1. **Modular Document Assembly:** Select and arrange pre-built sections (e.g., project experience, company profile) to build client-specific documents.
2. **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Use LLMs to draft text (case studies, summaries) from prompts or company data; future RAG integration for advanced use cases.
3. **Design Automation:** Apply custom branding and InDesign-like styling for polished, consistent layouts.
4. **File Integration:** Merge external Word/PDF files, images, and spreadsheets into designated sections.
5. **One-Click Export:** Generate print-ready PDFs or editable InDesign files for final tweaks.
6. **Smart Compliance Checks:** Industry-specific templates flag missing sections, word counts, or formatting errors for tenders/proposals.
7. **AI-Driven Personalization:** Auto-generate client-specific content while maintaining brand consistency.

## 6. Architecture (Updated: UXP Integration)

- **Frontend (React/Next.js):** Drag-and-drop UI for template/module selection, asset uploads, branding, and job triggers.
- **Backend (FastAPI + DDD):** Modular Python backend handles job logic, asset packaging, and agent dispatch; stores state in PostgreSQL and Blob Storage.
- **Agent (Windows Service + UXP Plugin):**
    - The local agent (Rust: for memory safetly and efficiency) manages plugin installation, version updates, and secure communication between the UXP layer and the cloud backend.
    - The Adobe UXP plugin runs as a sandboxed, event-driven bridge inside InDesign, exposing modern JavaScript APIs for text editing, layout, and export.
    - The UXP plugin communicates with the agent via WebSocket, receiving structured commands and returning document state changes or previews.
    - The agent translates frontend WYSIWYG editing actions into InDesign-native operations and ensures state synchronization across the system.
    - All InDesign operations remain local and sandboxed, preserving security and performance.
- **Data Layers:** PostgreSQL (metadata, logs), Azure Blob Storage (assets, PDFs), Redis/Azure Service Bus (future event queue).
- **Infrastructure & Dev Tools:** Podman + buildah, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Terraform/Bicep for GitOps automation.
- **Security Model:** Zero trust agent, OS isolation, signed bundles, clear environment boundaries.

## 6.2 Architectural Principles

| Principle                               | Description                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Immutable Infrastructure**            | Podman containers, atomic rollbacks                                                                            |
| **Containerization**                    | All services (frontend, backend, DB, queue) run in Podman containers                                           |
| **Toolbox for Dev**                     | Development runs inside Fedora Toolbox containers for safety and reproducibility                               |
| **Zero Trust Agent (ZTA)**              | The local agent runs in a signed, sandboxed environment (Windows VM), communicates securely                    |
| **Event-Carried State Transfer (ECST)** | All job logic, inputs, and configs are bundled into a self-contained payload sent to the agent then UXP plugin |
| **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**          | Backend cleanly separates core business logic from infrastructure (Hexagonal Architecture)                     |
| **GitOps**                              | Deployments are managed via Git-based pipelines, ensuring state consistency across environments                |
| **Adobe UXP Bridge**                    | UXP plugin provides a secure, event-driven, cross-platform automation layer for InDesign                       |
